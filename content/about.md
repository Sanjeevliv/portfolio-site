## Hi, I'm Sanjeev Sethi 👋

I am a software engineer transitioning into **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**. This portfolio documents my journey of building a production-grade platform from scratch to understand the deep systems that power modern applications.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills

*   **Languages**: Go, Python, Bash
*   **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes (GKE), Terraform, Docker
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Helm, ArgoCD (Planned)
*   **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry

### 🎯 Objective

My goal is to build resilient, scalable systems and automate away toil. This project, creating a microservices platform on GKE with full observability, is my proving ground.

## Hi, I'm Sanjeev Sethi 👋

I'm a B.Tech student at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal, with a deep interest in Site Reliability Engineering and network protocols like Multipath TCP. This portfolio showcases my hands-on journey of building a production-grade microservices platform on Kubernetes—from infrastructure provisioning with Terraform to implementing observability with Prometheus and OpenTelemetry.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills

*   **Languages**: Go, Python, Bash
*   **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes (GKE), Terraform, Docker
*   **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Helm, ArgoCD (Planned)
*   **Observability**: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry

### What I'm trying to do
Honestly? I want to understand how large-scale systems stay up. Not just the theory—the actual nuts and bolts. This project is my way of learning by doing.

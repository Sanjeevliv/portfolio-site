# Contributing to Open Source

As part of my journey to becoming a Site Reliability Engineer, I embarked on "Track 2: The SRE Contributor Path."

## The Goal

The goal was not just to build a portfolio project but to understand the ecosystem that powers it. This meant diving into the CNCF landscape and finding a project to contribute to.

## Finding an Issue

I started by looking for "good first issues" in the Kubernetes repository. Debugging distributed systems is complex, and understanding the codebase is the first step.

*(This is a placeholder post to demonstrate the blog functionality. In a real scenario, I would document the specific PR I opened, the feedback I received, and what I learned about code review in large open-source projects.)*
